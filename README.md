# Hack the Opportunities


## Contribution
This list is not complete and I alone cannot make it whole. This is where the community efforts come and so I made the list open Source! <br>
If you're interested in adding any opportunity to the above list, feel free to make a Pull Request with the following in the format above:
- Name of the program and type
- Deadline(approx)
- Relevant Link
- Blog/resources for the same

PS: Opportunities are classified based on the deadline months from previous years. 

If you have any other ideas, feel free to make an issue!
